### What Is Snapchat Score?

Snapchat Score is a number calculated based on your activity on the app. It is displayed on your profile and shows how engaged you are on Snapchat. The higher the score, the more active you appear. Snapchat determines this score using various factors, such as:
- Sending and receiving Snaps
- Posting Stories
- Maintaining Snap Streaks
- Adding friends and engaging with them
- Using Snapchatâ€™s Discover and Spotlight features

## Why Increase Your Snapchat Score?

There are several reasons why people want to increase their Snapchat Score:
- **Social Proof**: A higher score makes you look more active and popular on Snapchat.
- **Unlock Trophies & Rewards**: Some Snapchat features and achievements are unlocked based on your score.
- **Bragging Rights**: Compete with friends to see who can get the highest score.
- **Better Engagement**: Higher activity levels can improve your overall Snapchat experience.

## How to Increase Your Snapchat Score for Free

### 1. **Send More Snaps**
The easiest way to increase your Snapchat Score is by sending Snaps regularly. Each Snap you send increases your score by one point. Sending multiple Snaps at once boosts your score even faster.

### 2. **Receive and Open Snaps**
Your score increases when you open Snaps as well. So make sure you regularly check and open Snaps from friends.

### 3. **Post Stories Frequently**
Posting Snaps to your Story also contributes to your Snapchat Score. Try to post at least a few times a day to keep your score climbing.

### 4. **Maintain Snap Streaks**
A Snap Streak is when you and a friend send Snaps back and forth for consecutive days. Keeping streaks active can significantly boost your Snap Score over time.

### 5. **Add and Interact with Friends**
Adding new friends and engaging with them by sending Snaps or messages can contribute to your overall score.

### 6. **Use Discover and Spotlight**
Snapchatâ€™s Discover and Spotlight sections allow you to interact with trending content. Engaging with these features might help boost your activity level.

### 7. **Avoid Third-Party Apps & Hacks**
There are many apps and services that claim to increase your Snapchat Score instantly. However, these third-party tools violate Snapchatâ€™s policies and could get your account banned. Stick to legitimate methods to grow your score safely.

## Common Myths About Snapchat Score

### **Myth 1: Text Chats Increase Your Score**
Texting on Snapchat does not contribute to your Snap Score. Only Snaps (photos/videos) count.

### **Myth 2: Watching Stories Boosts Your Score**
While posting Stories increases your score, watching othersâ€™ Stories does not.

### **Myth 3: Deleting Snaps Increases Your Score**
Once a Snap is sent, deleting it does not add any extra points to your Snapchat Score.

## How Fast Can You Increase Your Snapchat Score?

The speed at which you can grow your Snapchat Score depends on your level of activity. Hereâ€™s a general idea:
- Sending 50 Snaps per day can increase your score by 350+ points per week.
- Maintaining 5 Snap Streaks can add hundreds of points over time.
- Posting 5-10 Stories daily helps keep your activity consistent.

## Conclusion

Boosting your Snapchat Score for free is easy if you stay active on the platform. By sending Snaps, maintaining streaks, and engaging with friends, you can grow your score naturally and enjoy all the benefits that come with it. Avoid third-party hacks and focus on consistent, real engagement to achieve the best results.

### **What is a Snapchat Score?**

Your Snapchat Score is a number displayed on your profile that increases based on your activity. It is calculated based on the number of snaps you send and receive, stories you post, and other engagement metrics. The higher your score, the more active you are perceived on Snapchat.

## **Why is Snapchat Score Important?**

## **How to Increase Snapchat Score for Free**

### **1. Send and Receive More Snaps**
Snaps (photos and videos) contribute directly to your score. The more you send and receive, the higher your score will be. However, texting alone does not increase your Snapchat Score.

**Tip:** Send snaps to multiple friends at once to maximize your score growth.

### **2. Post Stories Frequently**
Posting on Snapchat Stories also adds to your score. The more often you update your story, the more engaged your account appears, helping you gain more interactions.

**Tip:** Use engaging content like behind-the-scenes moments, travel experiences, or daily updates to keep your audience hooked.

### **3. Add More Friends and Stay Active**
Having more friends means more opportunities to send and receive snaps. Adding new people and interacting with them can help increase your Snapchat Score.

**Tip:** Join Snapchat communities on social media platforms to find new friends who are also looking to increase their scores.

### **4. Maintain Snap Streaks**
Snap Streaks are when you and a friend send snaps to each other for consecutive days. The longer the streak, the more your score will increase.

**Tip:** Set a reminder to send snaps daily to maintain your streaks.

### **5. Open Snaps from Others Regularly**
Opening snaps sent to you also contributes to your Snapchat Score. Even if you donâ€™t respond, make sure to check and open all incoming snaps.

Some websites and apps claim to boost Snapchat Scores artificially. Using them can lead to your account being **banned or suspended**. Stick to organic methods for a safe score boost.

Snapchat frequently introduces special challenges and interactive features. Engaging with these can also contribute to your overall activity and potentially boost your score.

### What is Snapchat Score?

Your Snapchat Score is a numerical value that represents your activity on the app. Snapchat calculates your score based on various factors, including:
- The number of Snaps you send and receive
- Posting on Snapchat Stories
- Maintaining Snap Streaks with friends
- Adding and interacting with new friends
- Using features like Discover and Spotlight

A higher score often signifies greater engagement and consistency on the platform.

Increasing your Snapchat Score has several benefits, including:
- **Social Recognition**: A high score makes you look more active and engaged.
- **Unlocking Snapchat Trophies & Features**: Some features become available as your score increases.
- **Competing with Friends**: Many users like to compare scores for fun.
- **Better Overall Experience**: More activity means more interaction with friends and content.

## Proven Ways to Increase Your Snapchat Score for Free

### 1. **Send More Snaps Daily**
Every Snap you send adds points to your score. The more Snaps you send, the faster your score increases. Aim to send multiple Snaps throughout the day.

### 2. **Receive and Open Snaps Regularly**
Your Snapchat Score goes up when you receive and open Snaps from others. Make it a habit to check and open Snaps promptly.

### 3. **Post Stories Frequently**
Uploading Snaps to your Snapchat Story also contributes to your score. Posting multiple Stories a day ensures consistent growth.

### 4. **Maintain Snap Streaks**
Snap Streaks are daily Snap exchanges with friends. Keeping these streaks alive adds up over time and is an easy way to boost your score.

### 5. **Add and Engage with New Friends**
Adding new friends and sending them Snaps increases your activity. Engaging with different users on Snapchat can lead to a higher score.

### 6. **Use Discover and Spotlight**
Interacting with Discover and Spotlight content keeps you active on the app and helps maintain consistent usage, indirectly supporting your score growth.

### 7. **Avoid Third-Party Hacks and Apps**
There are many apps claiming to boost your Snapchat Score instantly. However, using third-party services can lead to account bans. Stick to legitimate methods to keep your account safe.

## Common Myths About Snapchat Score

### **Myth 1: Text Messages Increase Your Score**
Texting friends on Snapchat does not contribute to your score. Only Snaps (photos and videos) count.

### **Myth 2: Watching Stories Boosts Your Score**
Watching other peopleâ€™s Stories does not increase your Snapchat Score. Only posting your own Stories contributes to it.

### **Myth 3: Deleting Snaps Affects Your Score**
Once a Snap is sent, deleting it does not impact your score. The points are already counted.

## How Fast Can You Increase Your Snapchat Score?

The speed of your Snapchat Score growth depends on how often you send Snaps. Hereâ€™s an estimated breakdown:
- Sending 50 Snaps per day can increase your score by 350+ points per week.
